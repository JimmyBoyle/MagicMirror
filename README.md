**MagicMirror²** is an open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, the **MagicMirror²** allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant. **MagicMirror²** is built by the creator of [the original MagicMirror](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror) with the incredible help of a [growing community of contributors](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/graphs/contributors).

MagicMirror² focuses on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary!
